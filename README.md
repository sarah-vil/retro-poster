# Retro Poster

This code creates a canvas element and uses JavaScript to draw a retro poster by adding a background color, a title, some text, an image, and a border on the canvas. The `draw` function sets the canvas background color to blue (#0080FF), adds a white title and text using different font sizes, and loads an image using an `Image` object and draws it on the canvas. The image source URL is set to a placeholder image for demonstration purposes only. Finally, a white border is added to the canvas. The CSS style sets a border around the canvas element for visual effect.
